## Values

Every value has a type (eg. number, string, function etc.). The type determines the value's role.

### Numbers

Numeric values. JS uses 64bits to store numeric values. JS does not differ between integers and floats.

Fractional numbers are written by using a dot.

Numbers can also bw written using scientific notation (ie. 3.14e6).

Arithmetic can be performed on numbers using the arithmetic operators (+, -, \*, and /).

In addition there is the % symbol to represent the remainder operation.

### Special Numbers

`Infinity` - represents positive infinity.

`-Infinity` - represents negative infinity.

`NaN` - Stands for "not a number", but, strangely, is a value of type number.

### Strings

Used to represent text. Written by enclosing their content in quotes (`, ', or "). Special characters (like the newline character) can be escaped with a backslash (\\).

Strings cannot be divided, multiplied, or subtracted. But the + operator allows string concatenation ("glueing" strings together).

Strings with backtick quotes are called template literals. They can embed other values inside \${}. The content inside the curly braces will be computed, converted to a string and included at that position.

## Types

These types are available in JavaScript:

- `String`
- `Number`
- `Boolean`
- `Symbol` (from ES6)
- `Object`
  - `Function`
  - `Array`
  - `Date`
  - `RegExp`
- `null`
- `undefined`

`Null` and `undefined` are used to denote the absence of a _meaningful_ value.They are values, but carry no information. They can mostly be treated as interchangeable.

The `typeof` operator examines a value and returns its type (as a string!).

```javascript hl=4,7 title=CodeBlock.js
let a
typeof a // "undefined"

a = 'hello world'
typeof a // "string"

a = 7
typeof a // "number""

a = true
typeof a // "boolean"

a = null
typeof a // "object" -- weird, bug

a = undefined
typeof a // "undefined"

a = { b: 'c' }
typeof a // "object"

a = [1, 2, 3]
typeof a // "object" -- weird, bug
```

## Operators

### Arithmetic Operators

- `-` (addition)
- `+` (subtraction)
- `/` (division)
- `*` (multiplication)
- `%` (modulus/remainder)

These behave as expected.

### Comparison Operators

- `<` (smaller than)
- `<=`(smaller than, or equal to)
- `>` (bigger than)
- `>=` (bigger than, or equal to)
- `==` (equal to) and === (_precisely_ equal to)
- `!=` (not equal to) and !== (_precisely_ not equal to)

Comparison of values always evaluates to a `Boolean` value.

### Logical Operators

- `&&` (Logical AND)
- `||` (Logical OR)
- `!` (Logical NOT)

### Ternary Operator

- `Boolean ? x : y;`

Evaluates a boolean expression on the left of the question mark. If the expression evaluates to true, the middle value will be chosen; if it evaluates to false, the far right value will be chosen.

## Automatic Type Conversion

When an operator is applied to different types of values, JavaScript will try to convert one value to the type it needs to perform the operation. this process is called _type coercion_.

For example:

```javascript
8 * null // -> 0
7 - '2' // -> 5
'7' + 2 // -> 72
'five' * 2 // NaN
false == '' // true

/* When performing comparisons, the == operator allows type coercion,
 while the === operator does not.*/

null == undefined // true
null === undefined // false
false == '' // true
false === '' // false
```

## Short-Circuiting of Logical Operators

The logical operators `&&` and `||` will convert the value on their left side to a `Boolean` in order to decide what to do. Depending on the result of the conversion and the operator used they will either return the original left/hand value or the right/hand value.

The `||` operator returns the left-hand value when that can be evaluated to `true` and returns the right/hand value otherwise.

This can be used as a way to fall back to a default value. For example:

```javascript
null || 'default' // -> default
'Bruce Wayne' || 'default' // -> Bruce Wayne
```

When the left-hand side evaluates to `false`, the `&&` operator will return that value and otherwise it returns the right-hand value.

Both of these operators only ever evaluate the right-hand expression if the left-hand expression evaluates to `true`. This is called _short-circuit evaluation_.

The ternary operator behaves the same in that only the expression that gets selected will be evaluated.
